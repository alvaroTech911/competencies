### 5. CODING STANDARDS

##### Code Formatting

- [x] While going through code, check the code formatting to improve readability and ensure there are no blockers

##### Architecture - *Summerize with example codebase (doesnt need to be yours but be able to explain)*
Front end: https://github.com/alvaro911/tourny-maker

Back end: https://github.com/alvaro911/tourny-maker-server

- [x] Separation of Concerns followed


- [x] Split into respective files (HTML, JavaScript and CSS)


- [x] Split into multiple layers and tiers as per requirements (Presentation, Business, and Data Layers)


- [x] Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies


- [x] Design patterns: Use appropriate design pattern (if if helps), after completely understanding the problem and context

##### Coding Best Practices - *Summerize*

- [x] No hard coding, use constants/configuration values


- [x] Group similar values under an enumeration (enum)


- [x] Comments - Do not write comments for what you are doing, instead write comments on why you are doing. Specify about any hacks workaround and temporary fixes. Additionally mention pending tasks in your to-do comments, which can be tracked easily


- [x] Avoid multiple if/else blocks


- [x] Use framework features, wherever possible instead of writing custom code

##### Non Functional Requirements - *Summerize*

https://github.com/alvaro911/tourny-maker/blob/master/src/actions/matchesActions.js
(Try or catch)

##### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Principles - *Summerize and show example*

https://github.com/alvaroTech911/js_library/tree/feature/withInit/src

- [x] Single Responsibility Principle (SRS): Do not place more than one responsibility into a single class of function, refactor into separate classes and functions


- [x] Open Closed Principle: While adding new functionality, existing code should not be modified. New functionality should be written in new classes and functions


- [x] Liskov substitutability principle: The child class should not change the behavior (meaning) of the parent class. The child classcan be used as a substitute for a base class.
      - Completed Interface Polygons class


- [ ] Interface segregation: Do not create lengthy interfaces, instead split them into smaller interfaces based on the functionality. The interface should not contain any dependencies (paramaters), which are not require for the expected functionality
      - Demonstrated in MVCMovie project: EXAMPLE Repo


- [x] Dependency Injection: Do not hardcode the dependencies, instead inject them
